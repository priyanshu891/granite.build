# Post-merge cleanup

You are helping a developer clean up after a PR has been merged into `upstream/main`. Follow these steps in order.

Issue number: $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Validate

1. Detect if we are running inside a git worktree:
   ```
   WORKTREE_DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   MAIN_REPO=$(git worktree list --porcelain | head -1 | awk '{print $2}')
   IS_WORKTREE=false
   if [ "$WORKTREE_DIR" != "$MAIN_REPO" ]; then IS_WORKTREE=true; fi
   ```
2. Confirm the current branch is an issue branch (not `main`)
3. Save the current branch name for later deletion
4. If no issue number was provided ($ARGUMENTS), try to auto-detect from the branch name:
   ```
   BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
   ```
   If `$BRANCH` matches the pattern `issue-<N>-*`, extract `<N>` as the issue number. Inform the user:
   > Auto-detected issue #N from branch name `<branch>`

   If the branch doesn't match and no `$ARGUMENTS` was given, ask the user for the issue number.

## Step 2: Close the issue

1. Close the issue in the upstream repo, if the merge didn't already (`Closes …` auto-closes it):
   ```
   gh issue close <N> --repo ibm-granite/granite.build
   ```
2. Confirm the issue was closed successfully

## Step 3: Update local integration branch and clean up

### If running in a worktree (`IS_WORKTREE=true`):

The worktree must be removed before the branch can be deleted. All remaining steps run from the **main repo directory**.

1. Change to the main repo directory:
   ```
   cd $MAIN_REPO
   ```
2. Remove the worktree:
   ```
   git worktree remove $WORKTREE_DIR
   ```
   If removal fails (dirty worktree), ask the user whether to force-remove (`git worktree remove --force $WORKTREE_DIR`) or abort.
3. Update the integration branch:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```
4. Delete the local issue branch:
   ```
   git branch -d <saved-branch-name>
   ```
5. Delete the remote issue branch on the fork:
   ```
   git push origin --delete <saved-branch-name>
   ```
6. Report completion to the user:
   > Cleaned up worktree `$WORKTREE_DIR`, deleted branch `<saved-branch-name>` locally and on origin, updated `main`.

### If NOT running in a worktree:

1. Switch to the integration branch and pull the latest:
   ```
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```
2. Delete the local issue branch:
   ```
   git branch -d <saved-branch-name>
   ```
3. Delete the remote issue branch on the fork:
   ```
   git push origin --delete <saved-branch-name>
   ```
4. Report completion to the user
