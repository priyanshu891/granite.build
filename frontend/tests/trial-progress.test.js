/**
 * Tests for the tuning run progress shown above the trials table.
 *
 * Users could not tell how far a run had got or how many trials were still
 * coming: `num_trials` (the planned total) was parsed in api/autotunex.ts but
 * rendered nowhere. Trials that do not exist yet are the whole point of the
 * request, so "queued" has to count planned-but-not-created trials, not just
 * the pending rows already returned.
 *
 * The estimate is deliberately conservative — it is withheld unless the run is
 * actually running, the planned total is known, and at least one trial has
 * finished to give a duration sample. A confidently wrong ETA is worse than none.
 *
 * Usage: node --test tests/trial-progress.test.js
