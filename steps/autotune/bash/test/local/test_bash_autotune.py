"""Integration test: the autotune step runs end to end on the bash environment.

This is a **step-level** test: it lives beside the autotune step's Makefile in a
per-cluster subdir (``steps/autotune/bash/test/local/``, "local" being the bash
environment's only target), with its fixtures in the matching ``test-data/local/``,
and is developed and run independently of the repository's central test suite (it
is not in ``testpaths``). Run it via ``make test`` with the repo-root ``.venv``
activated::

    make -C steps/autotune/bash test

``make test`` depends on ``make space``, so the git-ignored ``space/`` directory
that the ``buildtest.yaml``'s ``space_uri`` points at is always rendered before
pytest runs.

What it proves that the unit tests cannot: that ``run.py``'s ``GB_ARTIFACT_ID``
marker is actually scraped by the bash monitor and binds the ``custom`` output.
The step sets ``skip_finding_output_artifacts``, so the marker is the *only*
source of that binding -- if it lands mid-line, the build "succeeds" with no
output, which ``output_artifact_count: 1`` catches.

Cost: heavyweight. The first run builds a venv and pip-installs torch + ray
(fm-tune's ``core`` extra; ``main.py`` imports ray unconditionally), then runs a
single short LoRA pass with HPO disabled. Extended suite only.

Requires the fm-tune copy vendored at ``autotunex/src/fm-tune``; auto-skips when
it is absent or when not in the extended suite.

        The harness reads build.yaml/buildtest.yaml verbatim and has no parameter
        substitution of its own -- but the spec dir is whatever this method returns,
        so the two absolute paths a static fixture cannot express are filled in here:

          * ``@FM_TUNE_ROOT@`` -- the vendored fm-tune checkout. The step runs with
            its CWD in the build workdir, so a relative path would not resolve.
          * ``@DATASET_DIR@`` -- the fixture's dataset. gbserver resolves a relative
            ``file:`` URI against its OWN CWD, not this directory.

        Both are derived from this file's location, and ``parents[5]`` is the repo
        root in *either* test mode, so the same fixture works from both homes (see
        steps/README.md, "Two test modes"):
          Mode 1 (authoring)  steps/autotune/bash/test/local/
              -> steps/autotune/bash/test-data/local/   (co-located)

              -> test-data/steps/autotune/bash/local/   (parallel top-level tree)

        ``space_uri`` is resolved against the REAL fixture dir before being written
        out absolute, so publish-step's Mode-2 rewrite of that field still governs
        which Space is used.
