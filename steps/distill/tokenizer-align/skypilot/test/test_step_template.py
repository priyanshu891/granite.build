"""Contract tests for step-template.yaml.

The launcher's ``run:`` block is a ~140-line shell script carrying runtime Jinja,
and it hands off to ``src/run-align.sh``. Nothing else validates either before a
cluster does, and the failures are expensive: a shell syntax error costs a queue
slot, and an artifact id printed by the script but not declared in the template
makes the buildrun resolver drop the event, so the target completes with no output
AND no error.

These tests read the template and the script directly (not the rendered Space), so
they hold whether or not ``make space`` has been run, and they need no checkout of
the upstream distillation package.
