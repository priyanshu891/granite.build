"""Integration test: distill-gold runs multi-node end to end on Skypilot/LSF.

A **step-level** test, living beside the distill-gold step's Makefile in a
per-cluster subdir (``steps/distill/gold/skypilot/test/lsf/``) with its fixtures
in the matching ``test-data/lsf/``. Run it from the step directory::

    make -C steps/distill/gold/skypilot test

``make test`` depends on ``make space``, so the git-ignored ``space/`` directory
the fixture's ``space_uri`` points at is always rendered first; this test does no
rendering of its own.

What it proves that the unit tests cannot. The renderer and template tests cover
the config contract offline; only a real run shows that the two nodes each got
their own rank, that the config rendered *inside* the container against the /proj
checkout, and that rank 0 alone registered the checkpoint. The fixture asks for
``num_nodes: 2`` with a small model pair so it costs minutes rather than hours.

Requirements beyond the usual: a SkyPilot install with LSF multi-node support
(``sky.skylet.executor.lsf``). Without it gbserver refuses the launch outright
rather than running single-node and reporting success, so a missing dependency
surfaces as a launch error naming the pin, not as a silently wrong run.
