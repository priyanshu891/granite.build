"""The residency preflight is ONE program, copied into three steps and asserted identical.

Same argument as test_source_contract.py makes for the source-delivery region, and the same
mechanism: three subtly different copies of a check whose whole value is a hard-won pair of
invariants (mmlsattr is authoritative both ways; allocation may only ever accuse) is exactly
the failure this avoids. A step cannot import from a sibling step -- each publishes its own
src/ -- so a copy is the only option, and a checked copy is the difference between that and
drift.

THIS step is the reference: its test_check_weight_residency.py asserts the module is
*correct*, and this file asserts the other copies are byte-identical to it. Discovery is by
scanning for the invocation in every step-template.yaml, so a fourth step that wires the
preflight is covered here the moment it lands, with no list to update. The reverse direction
-- a weight-reading step that quietly stops wiring it -- is what the explicit list in
test_the_three_weight_reading_steps_all_wire_it guards, because discovery alone would go
green by finding nothing.
