"""Render the flat YAML config the GOLD trainer (gb_steps_post_training.distillation.gold)
consumes.

Why this is a Python script rather than a heredoc in the step's ``run:`` block.
Jinja does work there, so this is not about capability — it is about which
mistakes stay silent. Three of the trainer's requirements corrupt a run without
producing an error, and each is handled badly by a shell heredoc:

* ``learning_rate`` and the scheduler's ``min_lr`` must be YAML floats. PyYAML
  parses a bare ``1e-05`` as a *string*, which crashes the trainer's min_lr
  handling with a str/float TypeError partway into a run. Emitting through
  ``yaml.safe_dump`` of an actual float makes that structural instead of a
  formatting convention one edit away from breaking.
* ``min_lr`` must be nested under ``lr_scheduler_kwargs``, never top level. The
  trainer parses with TRL's ``parse_args_and_config``, which rejects unknown
  top-level keys, so a flat ``min_lr`` fails the run outright — after the model
  and teacher have already loaded.
* Booleans must be lower-case YAML. ``safe_dump`` does that by construction;
  templating emits ``True`` unless every site remembers to lower-case it.
* The six on-policy keys must be emitted **only** when ``vllm_num_servers > 0``.
  That is one testable branch here, versus ``{% if %}`` nested inside a quoted
  heredoc inside a YAML literal block — and it is exactly the seam the on-policy
  phase will reopen.

* The trainer's newer keys must be ABSENT, not false, when unused. ``ce_coef``,
  ``log_student_entropy`` and the entropy-guard trio are NOT at the commit
  ``code_config`` pins by default; they need a checkout carrying
  ``patches/ce_anchor_and_entropy_guard.diff``. Emitting them unconditionally would make
  every config here unreadable by any other checkout, and TRL rejects unknown top-level
  keys outright -- which is what ``--verify-trainer-accepts-keys`` turns into a refusal
  that names the patch instead of a failure on a held allocation. Emitting them only when they are non-default also keeps
  the rendered config of every existing recipe byte-identical, which is what
  ``test_off_policy_key_set_is_exact`` asserts.

Dumping with the same library the trainer parses with also means a config that
renders is a config the trainer can read.

#
# CustomGOLDConfig exposes nine boolean loss switches. They are NOT orthogonal, and this
# branch already knows it: gold-onpolicy-smoke/parameters.yaml notes that "CustomGOLDConfig
# rejects liger with several on-policy options". This table is that knowledge made
# mechanical, for the two kinds of invalid combination an enum cannot express:
#
#   (a) COMBINATIONS THE DATACLASS REJECTS in __post_init__. Failing here only saves the
#       allocation -- the run would have died anyway, just later and after the models loaded.
#
#   (b) COMBINATIONS THAT SILENTLY TRAIN THE WRONG OBJECTIVE, which is worse because the run
#       SUCCEEDS. use_liger_fused_jsd selects a fused-kernel branch constructed with beta,
#       alpha, temperature and use_kl_interpolation ONLY; every other secondary switch is
#       dropped by that path without a word. So liger together with use_ce_loss,
#       use_distillm2, use_distillm2_like, use_adaptive_kld or use_reversed_distillm2_like
#       trains fused generalized JSD while the config claims another objective. Exactly one
#       of those five is caught by the dataclass; the other four pass validation.
#
# DELIBERATELY WITHOUT TRAINER LINE NUMBERS. An earlier copy of this table cited
# custom_gold_trainer.py line numbers, and they were not transferable: they were read off a
# fork whose additions shift every line below them. A precise-looking wrong citation is worse
# than none, so the branch conditions are named by their flags -- which are stable -- instead.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT AN ARM, because `beta` already reaches it: forward KL is `jsd` at
# beta 0.0, reverse KL is `jsd` at beta 1.0. Arms for those would be two ways to say one
# thing, free to disagree.
#
# EACH ARM CARRIES ITS OWN REQUIREMENTS rather than having them coerced, because the second
# kind of requirement below is one nothing downstream would catch: outside its bounds the arm
# does not fail, it silently BECOMES a different arm.

    strips exactly one trailing newline from each VALUE. A real newline therefore

    ``<|im_start|>assistant``, masking loss from the wrong token with nothing to
    read. A two-character escape has no trailing whitespace to strip, so it arrives
    intact and is decoded here, once, at the far end.

    Deliberately not ``unicode_escape``: that codec round-trips through latin-1 and
    mangles any non-ASCII in a chat template. Only the escape the transport needs is
