"""Refuse a pinned corpus that this build does not describe.

The corpus is DEFINED by the retagged tokenizer and by the prep policies: the rows were
rendered through that chat template, the assistant masks were built with that tokenizer,
and 5,908 rows were dropped for exceeding THAT max_length. A pin taken from a run that
differed in any of those trains on a corpus this build does not describe, and every
metric downstream would still look normal.

So this turns that into a loud failure, and does it BEFORE the multi-node GPU allocation
is held. It reads one JSON file, so the cost of having it is seconds; the cost of not
having it is a run.

Usage:
  check_corpus_pin.py <corpus_dir> <teacher_model> <max_length> <think_policy>
                      <documents_policy> <eval_fraction> <tokenizer_dir> <out.json>
