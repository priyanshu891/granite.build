#
# Verbatim apart from `black`/`isort` reflow, which CI requires repo-wide, and ONE
# behaviour divergence recorded below. Keep it otherwise verbatim so re-syncing upstream
# stays a three-way merge.
#
# DIVERGENCE: `normalise_tokenizer_json` + its wiring in `export`, which clear the
# trainer's live truncation/padding state out of the published `tokenizer.json`. Upstream
# copies that file verbatim, so every model it publishes carries the trainer's last
# truncation budget (`max_length: 466` on build df8512e0's stage-1 export). See
# STRIP_TOKENIZER_JSON_RUNTIME_KEYS for why that is not cosmetic. This belongs upstream;
# until it lands there, the divergence lives here and the three-way merge has to keep it.
#
# DIVERGENCE: `tokenizer_pin_problems` + its call in `verify`, which assert that the
# published tokenizer, loaded the way a consumer loads it, segments exactly as its own
# tokenizer.json does. See TOKENIZER_PIN_PROBES. Same status as the one above.
#
# It imports gb_steps_post_training.distillation at MODULE scope, which is delivered at
# RUN time from the checkout named by code_config (see step-template.yaml). That is why
# the tests for this file are gated on GB_DISTILL_CODE_DIR — see test/conftest.py.

"""Turn a GOLD training output directory into a publishable HF model directory.

This step is a SELECTOR/PRUNER, not a format converter. That is a verified property, not
an assumption: the DeepSpeed config used by `distill-gold-train` sets
`zero3_save_16bit_model: true`, so `Trainer.save_model` already writes HF-native
`model.safetensors` at the checkpoint root. Confirmed directly on job 1136274's
checkpoint-25 -- a 704786224-byte `model.safetensors` (350M params x 2 bytes) sitting
beside the DeepSpeed `global_step25/` shard tree.

So there are exactly four jobs here, and none of them is a weight conversion:

  1. SELECT   which checkpoint-N is the release. The trainer does not decide this.
  2. PRUNE    the resumable-run state (DeepSpeed shards, optimizer, scheduler, RNG). This
              is also nearly all of the size difference -- ZeRO optimizer state is several
              times the weights.
  3. NORMALISE the DEFAULTS the trainer saved for its own use, of which there are three
              and all of them are about what a consumer gets when it asks for nothing:
                - `gold.py:345` sets `padding_side="left"` because the trainer generates.
                  That is right for generation and wrong as a published default, since a
                  right-padding consumer trusting `tokenizer_config.json` will silently pad
                  on the wrong side.
                - `chat_template.jinja:13` defaults `enable_thinking` to True, so
                  `apply_chat_template(..., add_generation_prompt=True)` hands out the
                  REASONING prompt. For a student distilled on a corpus with no think traces
                  that is the prefix the weights never saw. `--chat-template-thinking default-off` flips
                  it; see THINKING_POLICIES, which also records why this step refuses to
                  delete the empty `<think></think>` blocks themselves.
                - `tokenizer.json` carries the trainer's live `truncation` state, because
                  saving a tokenizer serialises what it was last configured to do. A
                  consumer reading that file through the raw `tokenizers` backend inherits
                  a truncation budget belonging to one training batch. See
                  STRIP_TOKENIZER_JSON_RUNTIME_KEYS.
              All are OPT-IN or reported, never silent: this step's contract is that the
              export manifest says exactly which defaults it changed.
  4. ASSERT   the pruned directory actually loads.

Deliberately NOT a job here: grafting in a tokenizer. `gold.py:454` passes
`processing_class=tokenizer` and loads it from the *student* path (`gold.py:341`), so each
checkpoint is self-describing and carries the retagged tokenizer the corpus was built
with. The step confirms that rather than repairing it.

# PreTrainedTokenizerFast exists in BOTH generations and loads `tokenizer.json`
# directly, so this rewrite changes the spelling and not the tokenizer. Only this one

# RUNTIME state that `save_pretrained` serialises into `tokenizer.json` itself.
#
# A trained tokenizer.json carries `truncation` and `padding` as explicit nulls. But the
# trainer's in-process tokenizer had truncation switched on for its own batching, and
# saving the tokenizer writes that live state into the file -- so the published model
# arrives with a budget nobody asked for. Observed on build df8512e0's stage-1 export:
#   "truncation": {"direction": "Right", "max_length": 466, ...}
# where the aligned student's was null. 466 is one training batch's longest sequence; it
# describes the trainer's last call, not the model.
#
# It is not cosmetic. transformers' PreTrainedTokenizerFast calls `no_truncation()` when a
# caller does not ask for truncation, so a transformers consumer is unaffected -- but a
# consumer that loads the file through the raw backend
# (`tokenizers.Tokenizer.from_file`, which is also how several serving stacks read it)
# inherits the 466-token limit and silently truncates every longer prompt.
#
# NOT in this list, deliberately: `post_processor`. The trainer writes an identity
# `TemplateProcessing` where align had null, and that one is genuinely inert -- it inserts

# THE ROPE RELOCATION, and the portability rule that generalises it.
#
# transformers 5 moved RoPE settings out of top-level config keys into a nested
# `rope_parameters` dict. The value is not corrupted by that move, it is RELOCATED -- which
# is why a key-by-key diff of a 4.57.6 config against a 5.8.0 one does not show it:
# `rope_theta` is not DIFFERENT, it is MISSING ON ONE SIDE.
#
#   key               align/retagged_student (4.57.6)  export-N (5.8.0)
#   rope_theta        10000000                         <ABSENT>
#   rope_parameters   <ABSENT>                         {rope_theta: 10000000, ...}
#
# Every consumer on the transformers-4 schema -- vLLM 0.11.0, which the whole eval stack
# serves through, and bfcl-eval -- reads the top-level field, does not find it, and falls
# back to the class default. Measured directly under transformers 4.55.4:
#
#   align/retagged_student        rope_theta -> 10000000    <- healthy
#   export-N as written          rope_theta ->     10000.0  <- 1000x too small
#   export-N with the hoist      rope_theta -> 10000000    <- repaired
#
# A RoPE base 1000x too small destroys long-range position information while leaving local
# coherence intact, so the published models wrote correct code and correct arithmetic and
# never emitted a `<tool_call>`: BFCL 0.0000 on 400/400 across every arm in this epic, from
# a single training step onward, while `eval-transfer` -- which loads through transformers
# and therefore reads `rope_parameters` correctly -- reported healthy divergences digit for
# digit. Two harnesses, one checkpoint, opposite verdicts. Restoring the one key returned
# BFCL 0.8025 against a 0.8000-0.8125 baseline.
#
# HOIST, NOT MOVE. The nested dict stays exactly as the checkpoint had it, so
# transformers-5 consumers are unaffected; the top-level key is added for the older schema.
# Verified inert on the newer one: transformers 5.8.0's config does not define a
# `rope_theta` attribute at all, so the added key changes nothing it resolves. (It is also
# dropped again if a transformers-5 process re-serialises the config -- this step publishes
# a final artifact, so nothing downstream does that, but a future step that re-saves a
# config through transformers 5 would silently undo the hoist.)
#
# WHY THE RULE IS NOT `rope_theta`. A fix naming one field protects one field, and the next
# transformers reorganisation lands this same bug silently somewhere else. The rule is
# structural instead: any NUMERIC scalar inside a nested `*_parameters` dict must also
# appear top-level with an equal value. `assert_config_portable` enforces it on what is
# actually written, which is what makes the guard outlive this particular field.

# refuses everywhere else. Numbers are safe because a number means the same thing to both
# generations -- it is the LOOKUP that moved, not the semantics.

# The trainer's gradient-checkpointing flag, which has no business on a published inference
# artifact. vLLM manages its own KV cache so this appears inert in the eval path, but a

# number -- transformers 4.55.4 loads it and hands back a `dict` where a float belongs, and
# any consumer doing arithmetic on `config.time_step_limit[1]` gets a TypeError. The
# portable move is therefore to DROP the key and let the consumer's own class default
# apply, which is exactly what the healthy 4.57.6-authored `align/retagged_student` config
# does -- it carries none of the three `time_step_*` keys at all.
#
# Safe here because the value IS the class default on both generations, verified:

# the sentinel spells. `verify()` re-checks that per export rather than trusting this note.
#
# The neighbours are left alone on purpose. `time_step_min: 0.001` / `time_step_max: 0.1`
# are plain portable floats, and they are also both exactly the 5.8.0 class defaults, so
# there is nothing to fix. They are not inconsistent with a `time_step_limit` of [0.0, inf]

# The published chat template's THINKING POLICY.
#
# `chat_template.jinja:13` reads
#   {%- set enable_thinking = enable_thinking if enable_thinking is defined else True %}
# so a consumer that calls apply_chat_template(..., add_generation_prompt=True) and says
# nothing about thinking gets the REASONING generation prompt:
#   enable_thinking=True   ->  '<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\n'      (template line 191)
#   enable_thinking=False  ->  '<|im_start|>assistant\n<think></think>' (template line 193)
#
# For a student distilled on a corpus with no think traces those are not equivalent, and the
# DEFAULT is the wrong one. Every labelled assistant span in that corpus begins with the
# literal `<think></think>` -- template line 90 prepends it to any assistant turn carrying no
# think markers, which job 1141677 measured as 120/120 spans. So the model was trained to emit
# `</think>` immediately after `<think>`, and was never once conditioned on `<think>\n`: the
# newline between the two markers does not occur anywhere in its training data. `default-off`
# flips line 13 so the published default is the shape the weights actually saw.
#
# WHY THERE IS NO `strip-injection` POLICY. The obvious reading of "strip the empty think
# block" is to delete line 90's injection, and that would be a defect. `<think></think>` is
# written at FIVE sites in this template, and they are not one feature:
#
#   line  90  INJECTOR     prepends it to a plain assistant turn with no think markers.
#   line 113  CANONICALISER tool-call turn, truncated history: rebuilds the turn with an empty
#                          block in place of the real trace.
#   line 119  INJECTOR     tool-call turn whose content is not a string: emits a bare block.
#   line 147  CANONICALISER plain turn, truncated history: same collapse as 113.
#   line 193  PROMPT       the enable_thinking=False generation prompt.
#
# `truncate_history_thinking` also defaults True (line 18), so 113 and 147 fire on their own
# for every assistant turn before the last user turn. Deleting only line 90 therefore renders
# ONE conversation two ways -- older turns keep the empty block via 113/147, the newest turn
# loses it, and the generation prompt still emits it at 193 -- which is a prefix shape no
# training example had. The empty block is load-bearing structure in this template, not
# decoration, so this step will not remove it. It changes which DEFAULT the consumer lands on
# and records that it did.
