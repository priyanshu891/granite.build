"""Contract tests for the vllm-server step-template.yaml.

These tests pin the CONTRACT — the readiness gate, the two markers, the monitor
overlay. Whether the trainer's NCCL weight-sync group can span two LSF allocations is
not something a test can answer; build 9973e766 answered it on BlueVela.

The failures they do catch are the ones that cost a queue slot and produce no
diagnostic: a shell syntax error, a marker that never fires so the consumer target
never dispatches, or a monitor overlay that gbserver rejects at config time.
