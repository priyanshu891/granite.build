    """Inline cluster SSH configs keyed by cloud.

    Each cloud holds a list of ``Host`` entries rendered verbatim into
    ``~/.<cloud>/config`` (the OpenSSH file SkyPilot's slurm/lsf provisioners
    read). Each entry is a mapping whose keys are the **exact OpenSSH directive
    names** from that file — ``Host``, ``HostName``, ``User``, ``Port``,
    ``IdentityFile``, ``IdentitiesOnly``, etc. — so the environment.yaml mirrors
    the config file 1:1 with no key translation.

    The ``Host`` value is the cluster alias SkyPilot references and is always
    literal; every other directive value is resolved by exact-name lookup against
    the environment's secrets, falling back to the literal when no secret matches.
    Multiple hosts per cloud are supported, so one environment can describe
    several clusters.

    Attributes:
        slurm: Host entries rendered into ``~/.slurm/config``.

    API server's boto3 can provision AWS and SkyPilot can upload the file to
    remote nodes for S3 access.

            class ``Skypilot`` but differ by ``kubernetes``/``slurm``/``aws``/
            ``lsf``).  Used by the ``SpaceURI`` resolver to gate steps that
            declare a ``subtypes`` list on their ``environment_configs``: a step
            with a non-empty list matches only environments whose ``subtype`` is
            in it (exact string match).  Any string is accepted — there is no
            predefined set.  When unset, the environment matches only steps that
