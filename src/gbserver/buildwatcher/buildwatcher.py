# Bound for every thread join in shutdown/cancel. An untimed join hangs the whole
# process with no diagnostic when a build thread wedges -- in CI that shows up as a
# job killed mid-run with no pytest summary.
#
# Abandoning a join is safe for *process exit* because build threads are daemons: they
# are created inside __worker_thread_run, which is started with daemon=True, and
# threading inherits that flag from the creating thread. A live daemon thread does not
# hold up interpreter shutdown. It is NOT a kill: the thread keeps running until the
# process exits, so the timeout is a last resort that trades a leaked thread (and any
# child process it owns) for a diagnosable failure instead of a silent hang. The real
# cure for the wedge is the dispatch guard in __start_build plus cleanup_nohup in the
# bash environment; this bound only ensures we report it rather than hang.
