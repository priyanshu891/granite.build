"""Process-wide registry of workload session leaders, for last-resort reaping.

Workloads are launched with ``start_new_session=True``, so each becomes its own
session and process-group leader and is therefore NOT reached by signalling the
server's own group. The owning environment reaps its group on the normal paths
(``Bash.cleanup_nohup``), keyed by ``launch_id`` on a per-instance dict.

That registry is unreachable once the owning thread is the problem: if a build
thread wedges, shutdown abandons the join (bounded by
``_SHUTDOWN_JOIN_TIMEOUT_S``) and the workload's process group is left running.
This module is the process-wide fallback so shutdown can still make a real
attempt, without needing the launch_id, the environment instance, or the event
loop the launch happened on.

Registration is best-effort bookkeeping, deliberately kept dependency-free
(stdlib only, no psutil) and safe to call from any thread.
