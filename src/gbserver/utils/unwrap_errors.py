def escape_for_one_record(text: str, max_chars: int) -> str:
    """Collapse multi-line text into ONE log record, bounded to ``max_chars``.

    The deployed log pipeline ingests one record per LINE (gbcli's
    ``output_format_plain``), so a multi-line trace is split into N records that get
    reordered and interleaved — which is why traces looked absent in the runner log.
    Escaping newlines keeps the text in one record, in order, and reverses trivially.

    Escapes BEFORE capping: escaping doubles every backslash and newline, so a cap
    applied to the raw text would let a backslash/newline-heavy trace emit a record
    up to 2x ``max_chars`` — the flood the cap exists to prevent. A cut is never left
    on a dangling backslash, which would make the tail un-escape to something the
    original never contained.

    Args:
        text: The raw, possibly multi-line text.
        max_chars: Cap for the escaped result, before the truncation marker.

    Returns:
        A single-line string; truncated with the pre-escape length noted if capped.

    SkyPilot's client re-raises the *API server's* exception object on our side
    (``sky/client/sdk.py:_raise_exception_object_on_client``). The object is
    unpickled fresh, so ``__traceback__`` and ``__cause__`` are empty and
    ``logger.exception``/``exc_info=True`` render a single bare line with no
    frames. The server-side traceback survives as a ``stacktrace`` string
    attribute (set by ``sky/server/requests/requests.py:set_exception_stacktrace``),
    which is the only place the failing path appears for errors raised remotely —
    an ``OSError`` built as ``OSError(errno, strerror)`` carries no ``filename``
    for :func:`format_oserror` to report.

    Searches the whole exception chain (``__cause__``/``__context__`` and
    ``(Base)ExceptionGroup`` members), not just ``e``: by the time a failure
    reaches a reporting layer it is typically wrapped — the production trace read
    ``RunFailed -> ValueError: failed during loading artifacts`` over the
    original OSError — and looking only at the outermost exception would skip the
    server traceback exactly where it is needed. Mirrors the traversal in
    :func:`unwrap_errors`.

    Returns None when no exception in the chain carries a non-empty ``stacktrace``
    string, so locally-raised exceptions (which have a real traceback) are
    unaffected.
