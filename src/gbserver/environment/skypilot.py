    When a drain in ``_abort_shielded_request`` times out, the underlying

    keeps running and can create/finish the cluster/job *after* the first by-name
    reclaim has already returned — the exact leak the reclaim exists to prevent,
    with no further attempt. This attaches a done-callback that fires a *second*
    reclaim when the orphaned future settles (i.e. once the resource, if any, has
    actually been created), so it is reaped best-effort. ``on_abort`` is
    idempotent (teardown/cancel-by-name tolerate an already-gone resource), so
    the extra call is safe when nothing leaked.

    Best-effort, with real limits:

    * **Loop already closed.** We only reach here 60s+ after the abort (the drain
      timeout), by which point the build has usually finished. In a one-shot
      ``gb`` invocation the event loop is then closed, so the done-callback never
      fires and *nothing is logged at all* — the resource is leaked silently. The
      ``except RuntimeError`` branch below only catches "no running loop" at
      ``ensure_future`` time, which is close to unreachable (if a callback fires,
      a loop is usually running); it does not cover the loop-already-gone case.
      In long-lived ``gbserver`` the loop outlives the build, so the reclaim does
      fire — this gap mainly affects short-lived CLI processes.
    * **Fire-and-forget.** The second reclaim is scheduled with no strong
      reference retained and its exceptions are never retrieved. This is safe
      only because both ``on_abort`` implementations
      (``_abort_provision._teardown`` and ``_abort_managed_launch._cancel_job``)
      swallow their own errors and complete quickly; a future ``on_abort`` that
      raised, or ran long enough to be GC'd mid-flight, would need a held

    SkyPilot keeps SSH connections to a login node alive for ``ControlPersist``

    ``SlurmClient`` enables) and reuses them across launches via a fixed control
    name, so a socket left over from an earlier launch lets a new one skip
    re-authentication — a changed ``cluster_ssh_configs`` key or host then
    silently has no effect within that window. Removing the sockets forces the
    next connection to re-authenticate against the freshly materialized config.

    The sockets live one level below the root returned by

    we glob ``*/*`` to reach them without depending on SkyPilot's private
    control-name hashing. Only entries that are actually sockets are removed
    (verified via ``stat.S_ISSOCK``), so a stray regular file or directory that
    happens to sit at that depth is left untouched.

    Best-effort: a socket that cannot be stat'd/unlinked is left in place

    filesystem — so the payload is reachable at exactly ``./<dst>`` from the run
    script's CWD (``$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR``), giving implicit per-target isolation.

    On the LSF/enroot backend the shared ``/proj`` tree is bind-mounted identity
    into the step container, so a payload written to ``${build_workdir}`` on the
    (sudo-less) login node is visible to the job at the same path; the SkyPilot
    backend's symlink-wrap is exempted for these shared roots (see the fork's

    needed.

    Absolute destinations pass through unchanged (the author's explicit fixed
    location). When ``build_workdir`` is unset (envs without ``shared_workdir``) a
    relative destination is likewise returned unchanged, preserving SkyPilot's own

    A ``~``/``~/``-prefixed destination is rejected, mirroring the source guard in

    The snippet always leads with ``set -eu`` so any failure in the prefix aborts
    before the step body runs, rather than silently executing the body in a wrong
    or unexpected state. The prefix is prepended ahead of each body's own
    ``set -eu``, so without this the body's flags would not yet be in effect while
    the prefix runs.

    When a ``build_workdir`` was provisioned (the env configures
    ``shared_workdir``), the snippet also emits ``mkdir -p`` + ``cd
    "$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR"`` so both the ``setup`` and ``run`` scripts start in that
    per-run workdir. Making the launcher own the ``cd`` lets step authors write
    outputs with relative paths and stay agnostic about where the step runs: they
    never need to reference ``$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR`` themselves. With ``set -eu`` in
    front, a failing ``mkdir``/``cd`` (or an unset ``$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR``) aborts
    fast instead of leaving the body running in the wrong directory.

    When no ``build_workdir`` is set (envs without ``shared_workdir``), no ``cd``
    is emitted — only ``set -eu``. SkyPilot then runs the scripts in its own
    default working directory (``~/sky_workdir``), which is exactly where its
    relative ``file_mounts`` rewrite places payloads (see ``_remap_relative_dest``,
    which leaves relative destinations untouched in this case). Injecting a ``cd``
    elsewhere (e.g. ``$HOME``) would move the CWD away from the mounted payloads,
    so relative-in/relative-out steps would fail to find them; not cd'ing keeps
    the run CWD aligned with the mount location.

        On a retry (RetryHandler tears the cluster down then relaunches the same
        name), the backend (slurm/lsf) allocation may not be released yet, so the
        relaunch can fail with "Failed to acquire resources". Rather than fail the
        whole build, retry the provisioning a bounded number of times with capped
        exponential backoff — the backoff gives the backend time to release. A
        failed provision can leave a partial INIT/FAILED cluster record under the
        same name, so tear it down before each retry. Non-transient failures
        re-raise immediately; on exhaustion the original error is re-raised
        (``reraise=True``) so the genuine message surfaces.

        Args:
            task: The ``sky.Task`` to launch.
            cluster_name: Deterministic cluster name for this launch.

                step can override via ``infra:``/``resources.cloud``. Decides

            ssh_rotator: Login-node rotator for this launch (HPC only; None
                otherwise). On a transient *SSH control-plane* failure — as
                opposed to a capacity failure, which does not rotate — it is
                advanced to the cluster's next candidate login node and the SSH
                config re-materialized before the retry, so a single wedged login
                node fails over instead of failing the build.

        Returns:
