"""Materialize inline SkyPilot config from a Skypilot ``environment.yaml``.

Write/merge-only. Three destinations are supported:

  * ``cluster_ssh_configs`` -> ``~/.<cloud>/config`` (OpenSSH ``Host`` blocks,
    merged by alias under a cross-process file lock). A **foreign** (non-gbserver)
    entry with differing content raises ``SkypilotConfigCollisionError`` —
    gbserver never clobbers a user's own hosts. A prior **gbserver-managed** block
    owned by the *same* environment with differing content is overwritten,
    self-healing a re-keyed entry; identical content is a no-op; a differing block
    owned by a *different* environment raises (a cross-environment alias clash is
    surfaced, not silently overwritten — the owner is recorded per alias). SkyPilot re-reads the single
    ``~/.<cloud>/config`` for a cluster's whole lifetime, and it caches SSH
    ControlMaster sockets keyed on (host, port, user) — NOT the key — so a
    re-keyed config is masked by a live socket until it expires. Clearing that
    socket so a credential change actually takes effect is a test-only concern,
    gated by ``GBTEST_SKY_SSH_RESET`` (see ``gbserver.environment.skypilot``);
    production leaves SkyPilot's socket management untouched. Single-host by
    design (the config files are host-local).
  * ``cloud_config`` -> ``~/.sky/config.yaml`` (deep-merged into the global
    SkyPilot config the API server / optimizer reads directly; the env's values
    win, unrelated keys are preserved).
  * ``aws_credentials`` -> ``~/.aws/credentials`` (INI, mode 0600, merged by
    profile under a cross-process file lock).

Connection/credential field values are resolved by exact-name lookup against
the environment's secrets, falling back to the literal value. The module is
pure-filesystem (no ``sky`` import) so it is unit-testable without the SDK.
