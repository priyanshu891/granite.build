# payload middleware) is served entirely under /dashboard/* and /_next/*.
# New pages under frontend/app/dashboard/ are covered automatically by the
# /dashboard prefix below; a new *top-level* page outside /dashboard needs a
# new prefix here. /api/v1/auth is the OIDC pre-auth login flow (see
# auth_routes.py) — deliberately public.
# The AutoTuneX reverse proxy (/api/autotunex) is deliberately NOT listed here.
# It needs an all-methods exemption so gbserver does not block it before
# forwarding, but it must not inherit this list's unconditional public status:
# the upstream provides no protection of its own (AutoTuneX defaults to
# auth_providers=["disabled"], which authenticates nothing), so an unconditional
# exemption would be an unauthenticated write surface — POST /api/autotunex/jobs
# launches a real build, DELETE removes datasets and configurations. It is
# instead gated on the request coming from loopback, in dispatch() below.

# (/api/v1/<one-segment>) immediately followed by a doc endpoint and nothing
# else. Anchoring to a *single* mount segment before the doc name is what keeps
# this from matching a data route whose trailing path parameter merely happens
# to be "docs"/"redoc"/"openapi.json" — e.g. GET /api/v1/secrets/user_secrets/
