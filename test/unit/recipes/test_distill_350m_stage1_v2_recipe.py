"""Unit tests for the distill-stage1-v2 recipe.

v2 is stage 1 retried after build df8512e0 produced a model worse on every one of the
30+ benchmarks measured. The run was mechanically perfect -- every step exit 0, no NaN,
no OOM -- and the objective is what failed: GOLD's loss IS the divergence, the student
was already SFT'd on this corpus family and therefore nearly satisfied it at
initialisation, and with no ground-truth term the only descent direction left for 7,640
steps was to become more certain. Entropy fell 42%, the generations became repetition
loops, and the train loss moved 2.7% and said nothing.

So what this file guards is different in kind from distill-stage1's tests. Those assert
the PLUMBING still works. These assert the four things that make v2 a different
experiment rather than a re-run, each of which is one edit away from silently reverting:

* the objective is anchored, and the anchor is REACHABLE (a patched trainer, pinned);
* the collapse is instrumented and the guard is armed;
* the horizon is bounded by steps, sized to the headroom that actually existed;
* the whole checkpoint curve survives, and every rung on the ladder is a checkpoint
  that will exist.

The last one is the subtlest. The ladder drives a Jinja loop, so CKPT_LADDER IS the
target graph: a rung that is not a multiple of GOLD_SAVE_STEPS names a checkpoint-N
directory the trainer never wrote, and the export target fails AFTER the training has
been paid for.
