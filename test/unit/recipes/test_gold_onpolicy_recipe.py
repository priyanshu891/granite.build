"""Unit tests for the gold-onpolicy-smoke recipe.

THE RECIPE HAS NOT RUN. These tests pin the graph wiring, which is where this shape
differs from every other recipe here and where the failures are silent: a target
that never dispatches because a binding was dereferenced with the wrong accessor, a
server that never gets torn down, a URL mangled by the wrong URI scheme. None of
those produce an error — they produce a build that sits, or two allocations held
until someone notices.

What no test can settle is the open question the recipe exists for: whether the
trainer's NCCL weight-sync group can span two LSF allocations. That needs BlueVela.
