"""Unit tests for the distill-onpolicy-v2 recipe.

This recipe has not run. What it guards against, therefore, is not regression but the
set of on-policy mistakes that are already documented as having happened once, every one
of which produces a run that COMPLETES and reports a plausible loss:

* serving the teacher instead of the student -- a different algorithm, not a crash;
* allocating a server and then generating locally, because --use_vllm defaulted False
  (build d77546a9, which logged not one request against an idle 8-GPU server);
* a server whose address never reaches the trainer, which is what the in-allocation
  split does: it passes no --vllm_server_host;
* an immediate-EOS collapse, where the teacher scores empty completions as rollouts;
* a stranded SERVICE allocation, because LSF clusters never autostop and teardown is
  gated on an artifact a crashed trainer never emits.

It also asserts the recipe is stage 1 v2 plus on-policy and nothing else, because the
question it exists to answer is where the sequences come from -- not what the objective
is, which stage 1 v2 already changed.
