"""BuildWatcher dispatch idempotence and bounded shutdown.

Two defects, both observed as the same CI flake (`test_cancel_reaps_workload_child`
failing on Python 3.11 while 3.12 passed the same commit):

* A build already running under this watcher could be dispatched a *second* time.
  The "already seen" lists only suppress a re-dispatch while the build still holds
  the dispatched status; a build that leaves PENDING and returns to it is dropped by
  the lists' garbage collection and looks new. The second runner relaunched the
  workload that the first one's cancellation had already reaped, so the test saw a
  live PID and blamed reaping.
* Shutdown and cancel joined threads with no timeout while holding
  ``_builds_lock`` -- the same lock the build threads need -- so a wedged thread
  hung the process with no diagnostic. In CI that is a job killed mid-run with no
  pytest summary.

These tests drive the private methods directly with stub threads/runners: the real
race needs 3.11 scheduling to lose, but the *guards* are deterministic.
