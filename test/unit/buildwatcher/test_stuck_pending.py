"""BuildWatcher stuck-PENDING re-arm (__redispatch_stuck_pending_builds).

A build whose runner never started, or died before reporting RUNNING, sits PENDING
with no live runner thread. Because dispatch is gated on the seen-list
(active_pending_builds), once recorded there it is never retried. The watchdog drops
such a build from the seen-list so the next poll re-dispatches it; it never fails the
build, and it leaves a build with a live runner alone.
