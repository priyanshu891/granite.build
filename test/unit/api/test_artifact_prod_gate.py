"""Unit tests for the PROD artifact-registration gate in ``register_artifact``.

The gate admits an artifact in the PROD environment iff its URI type is
production-safe (``URI.is_prod_safe()``). HfURI is always safe; LhURI is safe
only when it points at the production Lakehouse host; all other URI types are
rejected. These tests exercise the gate directly without any storage or secret
infrastructure — rejection paths raise before storage is touched, and the one
allow path mocks the downstream storage.
