"""Unit tests for the distill-gold step asset's response-template transport.

The trainer masks loss from the first token AFTER ``response_template``, so the
template's trailing newline is part of the mask boundary rather than cosmetic.
Getting it from a recipe to the trainer crosses a layer that silently eats it:
``fill_objtemplate`` (targetsteprun.py) runs every config string through Jinja,
and gbserver's SandboxedEnvironments are built without ``keep_trailing_newline``,
so Jinja's default strips exactly one trailing newline from each VALUE.

That is not hypothetical. Build d8470f14 (gold-sweep-smoke on BlueVela, 2026-09-14)
rendered ``"<|im_start|>assistant\\n"`` correctly into build.yaml, dispatched
``--response-template '<|im_start|>assistant'``, trained two steps against the
wrong span, and reported success — the exact silent failure the recipe exists to
gate. test_gold_sweep_recipe.py passed throughout, because it asserts on the
build.yaml render, one layer ABOVE where the newline dies.

The fix moves the newline out of the transport: recipes carry a literal backslash-n,
which has no trailing whitespace for anything to strip, and the step's renderer
decodes the escape exactly once at the far end. These tests cover both halves.
