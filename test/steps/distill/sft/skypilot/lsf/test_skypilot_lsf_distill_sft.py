"""Integration test: distill-sft runs end to end on Skypilot/LSF.

A **step-level** test, beside the step's Makefile in a per-cluster subdir with its
fixtures in the matching ``test-data/lsf/``. Run it from the step directory::

    GB_STEP_BLUEVELA_BUILD=1 make -C steps/distill/sft/skypilot test

The fixture is a three-target chain (align -> corpus -> train-sft): the student must be
the retagged model, and the corpus must be built with that tokenizer.

What it proves that the offline tests cannot. test_step_template.py covers the config
contract, the flag surface and the newline transport; the 94 ported unit tests cover the
config renderer and its guards. Neither starts a trainer. Only a real run shows that
accelerate + DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 come up on this image — whose trl is 0.26.2, the version
whose private import_utils attributes sft.py monkeypatches — that gpus_per_node matched
what LSF granted, and that a checkpoint registered.

Deliberately tiny: one H100, 16 rows, save_steps 1, so it costs minutes and still
exercises checkpoint publication.
