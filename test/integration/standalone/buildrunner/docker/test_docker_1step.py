"""Integration test for the Docker command step with HF URI input/output.

Validates the full pipeline:
  HF URI input  →  Docker container (command step)  →  HF URI output

The Docker daemon must be available.

The fixture's build.yaml and buildtest.yaml live in the directory returned by
_get_yaml_spec_dir below.
