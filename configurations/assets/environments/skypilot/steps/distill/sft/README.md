# sft (SkyPilot / LSF)

Plain SFT on the distillation corpus, with **no teacher**. It is a `training` step that runs on
the LSF SkyPilot environment only (`subtypes: [lsf]`), on one GPU node, in the prebuilt
`docker:us.icr.io/cil15-shared-registry/kd-sandbox-distill:0.1.0-uv` image; it builds no image.
With `precomputed_logits_dir` set, the same step becomes forward-KL distillation against a
frozen teacher — see [Two uses](#two-uses-and-the-second-one-is-not-a-control).

> **Developing or testing this step?** See `steps/distill/sft/skypilot/README.md` in the
> granite.build repository for how the step is generated, tested, and published — including the
> ported upstream tests that need a distillation checkout (`GB_DISTILL_CODE_DIR`).

## Referencing the step

Point your build's Space at one that provides the step, then reference it by the stable
`space://steps/distill/sft` URI:

```yaml
steps:
  - step_uri: space://steps/distill/sft
```

## Config contract (`sft_config`)

All fields in these tables live under the step's `config.sft_config`.

### Required

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `student_model_path` | string | Local directory of the **retagged** student, normally the `retagged_student` output of the `space://steps/distill/tokenizer-align` step. Empty, or not a directory, is refused. A control trained on the base student would also differ in its embedding rows for the control tokens, so the comparison would measure two things at once. |
| `corpus_path` | string | The `corpus` output of the `space://steps/distill/corpus-prep` step (the `train.jsonl` file). Empty, or a path that does not exist, is refused. The student must also be the tokenizer the corpus was built for. |

### Optional

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `output_dir` | string | Trainer output directory and the `checkpoint` artifact; relative values resolve against `$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR`. Default: `sft`. |
| `check_weight_residency` | boolean | Runs `src/check_weight_residency.py` on the student before launch, to refuse when GPFS has migrated its weights to tape. See [Weight residency](#weight-residency). Default: `true`. |
| `allow_offline_weights` | boolean | Proceed through a migrated-weights refusal, loudly. For when the recall is already under way. Does not override a weight path that cannot be stat'd. Default: `false`. |
| `response_template` | string | Fallback masking string, used only when the student's chat template has no `{% generation %}` markers. Carried as a literal backslash-n; see [The response template's trailing newline](#the-response-templates-trailing-newline). Default: `'<\|im_start\|>assistant\n'` (single-quoted). |
| `max_length` | integer | Must be the same parameter the corpus was filtered at and the eval steps measure at. Default: `4096`. |
| `per_device_train_batch_size` | integer | Default: `1`. |
| `gradient_accumulation_steps` | integer | Default: `8`. |
| `learning_rate` | string | A number, quoted so that `1e-6` survives YAML 1.1 (which parses bare `1e-6` as a string); converted to a float by the renderer, which refuses a non-number. Default: `"1e-6"`. |
| `num_train_epochs` | number | Must be > 0. Default: `1`. |
| `save_steps` | integer | Must be >= 1: this step runs on preemptable capacity, so a run that never checkpoints loses everything on the first preemption. Default: `100`. |
| `seed` | integer | Default: `42`. |
| `resume` | string | `auto` \| `never` \| `require`. The trainer resumes on the mere **presence** of a checkpoint directory, so this is enforced as preflight validation rather than trusted. Default: `auto`. |
| `deepspeed_config` | string | Accelerate DeepSpeed config. **Relative resolves against the delivered checkout**; a missing file fails the step before launch. Default: `steps/distill-gold-train/configs/deepspeed/accelerate_deepspeed_zero3.yaml`. |
| `use_liger_memory_opt` | boolean | Fused linear+CE loss, no model-internal patching. Default: `false`. |
| `use_liger_swiglu_mlp` | boolean | Liger tiled-MLP patch to `GraniteSWAMLP`. **`true` is refused**: the patch is not part of this collection. Default: `false`. |
| `precomputed_logits_dir` | string | **Setting this stops the step being a control**: it becomes forward-KL distillation against the teacher logits in this directory (an output of the `space://steps/distill/logit-precompute` step). Must be a directory when set. Default: `""`. |
| `kd_top_k` | integer | KD only. Must be >= 1. Default: `256`. |
| `kd_weight` | number | KD only. Must be >= 0, and > 0 when `precomputed_logits_dir` is set. Default: `1.0`. |
| `ce_weight` | number | KD only. Must be >= 0; `kd_weight` and `ce_weight` may not both be 0. Default: `0.0`. |
| `kd_temperature` | number | KD only. Must be > 0. Default: `1.0`. |
| `max_dataset_size` | integer | Debug knob: `-1` = the whole corpus, or a positive row count. `0` and other negatives are refused. Default: `-1`. |
| `extra_config_yaml` | string | YAML mapping for the long tail of `CustomSFTConfig`. Merged **under** the explicit keys, so a collision is an error rather than a silent winner. Default: `""`. |

> **The `kd_*` keys are refused when changed without `precomputed_logits_dir`.** They are read
> only on the precomputed-logits path, so a changed value with no logits directory expresses an
> intent nothing would honour; the renderer stops instead of training plain CE under a config
> that reads as KD.

### Workload (`workload`)

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `gpus_per_node` | integer | **Asserted** against the GPUs visible in the container (`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`, else `nvidia-smi -L`); a mismatch fails the step. Must match the allocation the target requests. Default: `8`. |
| `nodes` | integer | Only `1` is accepted; more is **refused**. Default: `1`. See [Single node only](#single-node-only). |
| `hf_home` | string | Overrides `HF_HOME` for this step only; empty leaves the launcher's value. Default: `""`. |

### Experiment tracking (`tracking`)

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `clearml_project` | string | Default: `""`. |
| `clearml_run_name` | string | Default: `""`. |
| `wandb_entity` | string | Default: `""`. |
| `wandb_project` | string | Default: `""`. |
| `wandb_run_name` | string | Default: `""`. |

All five empty means tracking off; see [Tracking](#tracking) before setting any of them.

### Monitor (top-level `config`)

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `poll_interval_seconds` | integer | Monitor poll interval. Default: `900`. |
| `log_retrieval_mode` | string | Log retrieval mode. Default: `periodic` — a training run lasts far longer than the library's default `on_completion` mode surfaces anything for, so a stalled run would look identical to a slow one. |
| `log_retrieval_interval_seconds` | integer | Log retrieval interval. Default: `900`. |

### Source delivery (`code_config`)

`code_config` is identical in every ported distillation step and is documented once — see
"Source delivery" in the `space://steps/distill/tokenizer-align` step's README. No field is
required; the defaults clone a public repository unauthenticated.

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `code_dir` | string | Filesystem checkout to use instead of cloning. Default: `""` (clone). |
| `expect_ref` | string | Commit a `code_dir` checkout must be at. Default: `a5d59bc45524a8d75706e20d44ae1a254f273f23`. |
| `repo` | string | Repository cloned when `code_dir` is empty. Default: `https://github.com/laminair/gb-steps-distillation.git`. |
| `ref` | string | Ref checked out after the clone. Default: same commit as `expect_ref`. |
| `workdir` | string | Clone destination, relative to the working directory. Default: `distill-code`. |
| `token_secret` | string | Name of a space secret for a private clone. Default: `""`. |
| `python` | string | Interpreter. Default: `/stage/.venv/bin/python`. |
| `setup_command` | string | Bash run after the source resolves, before the workload. Default: `""` (skipped). |

## Inputs and outputs

### Inputs

The step declares no `inputs:` of its own. The target binds two upstream outputs and passes
their paths through config:

- **student** — `align.retagged_student` (the `space://steps/distill/tokenizer-align` step),
  passed as `student_model_path: "{{ bindings.student.binding.path }}"`;
- **corpus** — `corpus.corpus` (the `space://steps/distill/corpus-prep` step), passed as
  `corpus_path: "{{ bindings.corpus.binding.path }}"`.

For the KD arm, `precomputed_logits_dir` is wired the same way from the
`space://steps/distill/logit-precompute` step.

### Outputs

| Output | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `checkpoint` | `model` | The trainer's `output_dir`. Emitted as `GB_ARTIFACT_ID:checkpoint GB_ARTIFACT_PATH:<abs output_dir>`. |

Declare it on the target as `uri: "env://{{ binding.path }}"`, `type: model`. In epic 61's
pipeline it is bound (`train-sft.checkpoint`) as the student of the `space://steps/distill/gold`
step.

## Working directory and paths

The run starts in the step's working directory, `$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR` (falling back to `$PWD`).
`src/` is mounted at `./src`; `./src/run-sft.sh` renders the trainer config with
`./src/render_sft_config.py` and launches upstream's `sft.py` through `accelerate`. The shared
package and `sft.py` come from the delivered checkout, cloned into
`$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR/<code_config.workdir>` (default `distill-code`) or taken from
`code_config.code_dir`; the step points `run-sft.sh` at it with
`SFT_SRC=$CODE_DIR/src/gb_steps_post_training/distillation` and
`LIB_DIR=$CODE_DIR/steps/distill-sft/src/lib`.

- A relative `output_dir` is absolutised against `$GB_BUILD_WORKDIR` before the artifact marker
  is printed, because the monitor hands the path to the `env://` store, possibly from another
  host, and a relative `env:` URI is rejected at config load.
- A relative `deepspeed_config` resolves against the delivered checkout (`$CODE_DIR`).
- `student_model_path`, `corpus_path` and `precomputed_logits_dir` are passed through unchanged,
  so give them as absolute paths.
- `run-sft.sh` puts its preprocessing cache in `sft-preprocess-cache/` beside `output_dir` (its
  parent directory), so runs writing different output dirs under one parent share it; set
  `SFT_PREPROCESS_CACHE_ROOT` to override.

## Example build.yaml

The warm-up stage, after align and corpus-prep (their targets as in the
`space://steps/distill/corpus-prep` step's example):

```yaml
    train-sft:
      environment_uri: space://environments/skypilot/lsf/ibm-bluevela
      inputs:
        student:
          binding: align.retagged_student
        corpus:
          binding: corpus.corpus
      outputs:
        checkpoint:
          uri: "env://{{ binding.path }}"
          type: model
      steps:
        - step_uri: space://steps/distill/sft
          config:
            compute_config:
              num_nodes: 1
              num_gpus_per_node: $${NUM_GPUS_PER_NODE}
            workload:
              gpus_per_node: $${NUM_GPUS_PER_NODE}   # must match the allocation
              nodes: 1
            sft_config:
              student_model_path: "{{ bindings.student.binding.path }}"
              corpus_path: "{{ bindings.corpus.binding.path }}"
              output_dir: "$${RUN_NAME}/train-sft"
              max_length: $${MAX_LENGTH}             # the corpus's own budget
```

`max_length` must be the same parameter the corpus was filtered at and the eval steps measure at.

## Notes and limitations

### Two uses, and the second one is not a control

With `precomputed_logits_dir` **empty** this is the SFT baseline the distillation arms are
measured against. Every number an arm reports is a comparison; without this step the honest
statement about a distillation run is *"it got better at something, possibly just from more
training on this data."* The `arm` line near the top of the log says which of the two ran.

**Set `precomputed_logits_dir` and the same step becomes forward-KL distillation** against a
frozen teacher — the `space://steps/distill/logit-precompute` arm, wearing this step's name. A
recipe that sets it should say so in its own README.

In epic 61's pipeline this step's role is the **SFT warm-up stage** rather than a parallel
control: its checkpoint becomes the GOLD student. That is a recipe-level choice; the step is the
same either way.

The optimization keys (`per_device_train_batch_size`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`,
`learning_rate`, `seed`) have the same names and defaults as the `space://steps/distill/gold`
step, deliberately: a control that trains at a different batch size or learning rate than the
treatment is not a control.

### The response template's trailing newline

The single easiest thing to get silently wrong here, and it is a **transport** problem rather than
a config one.

`sft.py` builds assistant masks from `apply_chat_template`'s `{% generation %}` markers and raises
if the mask is all zeros. `response_template` is its *fallback*: a literal string searched for in
the rendered token ids. Its trailing newline **is the data** — that is where loss masking begins.

But gbserver fills every config string through Jinja, and its `SandboxedEnvironment`s are built
without `keep_trailing_newline`, so **Jinja strips exactly one trailing newline from each value**:

```
'<|im_start|>assistant\n'   ->  '<|im_start|>assistant'
```

A run then masks a span one token off, trains, and reports success — nothing errors, no NaN,
checkpoints written, loss plausible. That was measured on the `space://steps/distill/gold` step
(build `d8470f14`) and is fixed the same way here: the default is **single-quoted YAML holding a
literal backslash-n**, which has no trailing whitespace for anything to strip, and the launcher
decodes it once inside the container.

The decode uses a sentinel — `"$(printf '%b.' "$V")"` then strip the `.` — because `$(...)`
*also* strips trailing newlines, so the obvious form loses exactly the character the mechanism
exists to carry. A test executes both forms and asserts the sentinel version keeps one more byte.

With the `space://steps/distill/tokenizer-align` step in the pipeline the `{% generation %}`
markers are present, so the fallback should never be reached. It matters anyway: it is what runs
if a student arrives without them. A student with no markers **and** an empty
`response_template` is refused before launch.

### Weight residency

`check_weight_residency` refuses to launch when GPFS has migrated the student's weights to tape,
where the first read blocks on a recall with the GPUs already held. It reads metadata only
(`mmlsattr -L`, else `st_blocks` arithmetic) and never reads a shard:

- `mmlsattr` reporting `OFFLINE` is authoritative and refuses; reporting resident clears the file.
- Without `mmlsattr`, the `st_blocks` heuristic can only condemn: a weight file of 16 MiB or more
  with under 50% of its size allocated refuses; otherwise it warns and starts normally.
- A weight path that does not exist or cannot be stat'd also refuses, and `allow_offline_weights`
  does not override that — it is not a tape recall.
- A hub id rather than a path is skipped, not condemned.

`precomputed_logits_dir` is deliberately not checked: it holds no weight shards and is streamed.

### `deepspeed_config`

gb-steps-distillation ships exactly one deepspeed config, under `distill-gold-train`'s own
directory (`steps/distill-gold-train/configs/deepspeed/`) — `distill-sft` there has none of its
own and reuses that one. `configs/distillation/deepspeed/` was the pre-port path (an in-image
`/opt` copy that does not exist in this image) and stayed as a stale default through the port,
until a real run confirmed it missing (build `30e46247`: "deepspeed config not found"). It is an
**accelerate** config, not a bare DeepSpeed one, and it is load-bearing — its own header records a
predecessor whose `offload_param  offload_param_device: none` parsed as *one* key, so the setting
was silently dead. A typo in this file does not fail loudly.

### Boolean flags are rendered as pairs

`use_liger_memory_opt` / `use_liger_swiglu_mlp` are rendered as `--flag`/`--no-flag` pairs.
**This step is where that house rule was learned**: Jinja renders a YAML boolean with Python
casing, so `--use-liger-memory-opt {{ … }}` reached the script as the literal string `False`;
nothing errors, and a shell test against `"true"` is then false forever, silently, in both
directions.

`use_liger_swiglu_mlp` monkey-patches `GraniteSWAMLP.forward`, is needed only for long-context
(>=64K) GraniteSWA training, costs ~2-3x MLP forward, and applies to no model this collection
trains. Its module is not in the collection, so `true` is refused at render time rather than
failing with an ImportError minutes into an allocated run.

### Single node only

`nodes > 1` is **refused**. The script gets no host list, so a multi-node `accelerate launch`
would have no `main_process_ip`, port or `machine_rank` per host. Refusing beats launching one
node while reporting N — which would train a control at 1/N of the declared global batch and
report the declared one. Lifting it needs the provisioner's `RANK`/`TOTAL_NODES`/`MASTER_ADDR`
fed in as the `space://steps/distill/gold` step does.

`gpus_per_node` is asserted for a related reason: a mismatch between what the recipe asked for and
what LSF granted is a run that trains at a different effective batch size than the config says.

### Tracking

All five `tracking` keys empty means off. A step that invented a project name would log every
recipe's runs into one bucket. A *partial* config aborts rather than being completed with a
guess, because neither backend fails on an incomplete config — they log to their own defaults,
which is how a multi-day run ends up somewhere nobody looks.

**Measured for this image: `clearml` and `wandb` are both absent.** `tracking.py` imports them
lazily and only when a project is configured, so empty is safe — but setting any of these five
would fail at import.

### Hub kernels

The launcher does not set `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`, and sets `GOLD_PREFETCH_KERNELS=1` so `run-sft.sh`'s
kernel preflight fetches any required hub kernel missing from the image's cache inside the job.
The image caches `kernels-community/{mamba-ssm,causal-conv1d}` but not
`kernels-community/flash-attn2` (build `0e60920a`), which transformers needs because the renderer
selects `flash_attention_2` for a granite student. This costs a hub fetch per run, since
`/opt/hf-cache` does not persist; a warm shared cache (upstream's
`scripts/bluevela/prefetch-kernels.sh` against a persistent `workload.hf_home`) avoids it.
