# PORTED, not authored here. Upstream source of truth:
#   repo   github.ibm.com/Herbert-Woisetschlaeger/gb-steps-collection-post-training
#   path   steps/distill-tokenizer-align/src/run-align.sh
#   commit 70c1550a171aa8e09a9ad9047a5bf763c39e8579
#
# The ONLY intentional divergence from upstream is the artifact marker prefix:
# LLMB_ARTIFACT_* -> GB_ARTIFACT_*. granite.build's shipped monitor accepts both
# (its line_regex is "(?:GB_|LLMB_)ARTIFACT_ID:..."), so this is convention, not
# necessity — but GB_ is what every other step in this repo prints.
#
# Keep this file a near-verbatim copy so re-syncing upstream stays a three-way merge
# rather than an eyeball diff. Behaviour changes belong upstream, not here.
#
# Tokenizer alignment: build the teacher and student overlays, then retag the student
# onto the teacher's tokenizer.
#
# THE THREE STAGES ARE INDEPENDENT, and an earlier version of this header claimed
# otherwise. It said the order was load-bearing because the retag had to read the teacher's
# tokenizer from the overlay rather than from the teacher directory. That was wrong, and
# executing the rendered step command (LSF job 1137372) proved it: stage 3 died on a
# missing config.json, because an overlay is a tokenizer and retag_student needs a MODEL --
# vocab_size and the bos/eos/pad id scheme live in config.json and nowhere else.
#
# The reason the overlay bought stage 3 nothing is worth stating, because it is the same
# reason the fix is safe: retag_student.py never goes through AutoTokenizer. It reads
# tokenizer.json as raw JSON, copies three tokenizer files, and pins tokenizer_class on its
# own output. So it is immune BY CONSTRUCTION to the trap the overlay exists to dodge --
# a Granite dir's tokenizer_config.json declares `tokenizer_class: "GPT2Tokenizer"`, so
# AutoTokenizer builds THAT class, which rebuilds its backend from vocab+merges and
# installs a plain ByteLevel(use_regex=True) -- discarding whatever pre_tokenizer
# tokenizer.json stored. It does not error, and it still reports is_fast=True: CLASS
# IDENTITY is the mechanism, not fast-versus-slow. Stage 3 takes "$TEACHER_MODEL" for
# that reason, and the overlays exist for the DOWNSTREAM consumers that do load a
# tokenizer through transformers.
#
# Two things NOT to infer from that (both measured -- jobs 1136957/1137115/1137253, and
# see docs/tokenizer_mismatch.md):
#   - It is not the legacy vocab.json/merges.txt sidecars. Under transformers 5.8.0 those
#     are inert; the overlay excludes them for hygiene, not for protection.
#   - Deleting the key is not sufficient either. With a config.json present, the
#     `model_type: granite` fallback through TOKENIZER_MAPPING_NAMES revives the override
#     even with the key absent -- so build_overlay PINS it to PreTrainedTokenizerFast.
#
# Worth knowing while reading the two stages below: on THIS teacher the override happens
# to be a no-op, because granite-4.2's own tokenizer.json pre_tokenizer is already a plain
# ByteLevel. The bug bites the 4.1 base STUDENT, whose pre_tokenizer is
# Sequence[Split(regex), ByteLevel] -- the override discards that Split. Both overlays are
# built anyway: the teacher's costs nothing and stops the asymmetry from being load-bearing.
#
# WHAT THE PIN DOES NOT DO, because this is the trap one family up. Pinning the class stops
# the lookup from replacing the rule stored in tokenizer.json; it does NOT decide whether
# that stored rule is the one the model was TRAINED with. For the 4.1/4.2 family it is,
# which is why the pin is the whole fix for this pairing. For granite-5.0-20b-sft it is
# NOT: its stored Sequence[Split(regex), ByteLevel(use_regex=False)] is vestigial, and the
# model's own likelihood prefers the imposed plain ByteLevel by 17.0-19.8% of TOTAL NLL
# over 512 documents (jobs 1857118, 1857242), so the pin ALONE turned a working directory
# into one that cost an 8-GPU arm at 0/24 steps. Such a teacher needs the pin PLUS a
# pre_tokenizer transplant (scripts/bluevela/build-model-mirror.py --pre-tokenizer-from),
# and which rule it was trained with is a MEASUREMENT, not a reading of its files:
# scripts/bluevela/compare-tokenizer-nll.py, ranked on TOTAL NLL and never PPL/token --
# two pre-split rules emit different token counts, so a per-token mean is not comparable
# across them, and the older 26.1-vs-3.29 band does not transfer because that was a slow
# class rebuilding the MERGES.
#
# WHY ONE STEP AND NOT TWO. Overlay-building and retagging are both tokenizer alignment
# against the same teacher and they are always run as a pair -- every consumer that wants
# a retagged student also wants the overlays, because they have to agree about the
# tokenizer. (Not, as this comment previously said, because the retag consumes the overlay:
# it does not, see above.) Split apart they would be two steps that a recipe has to wire
# to the same teacher and that nothing would check had been.
