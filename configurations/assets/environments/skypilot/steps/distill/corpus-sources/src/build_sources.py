"""Build ONE corpus file from several SFT splits, because three things are true at once
and no single one of them is optional:

  1. prep takes ONE path. prep_corpus.py:294 refuses a directory outright -- "Pass the
     .jsonl itself, or an HF dataset id" -- so there is no glob and no list form to hand
     it three files with.

  2. THE ROWS ARE SPELLED `conversations`, NOT `messages`. prep reads
     record.get("messages") (prep_corpus.py:367) and returns `no_messages` otherwise.
     Handed these files unchanged it would drop all 5,081,504 rows and raise PrepError.
     This rename is the single most load-bearing line in the step.

  3. The splits are wildly unequal -- general 84.86%, tools 13.98%, rag 1.17% -- and
     prep's max_examples stops after N KEPT rows IN INPUT ORDER. A plain concatenation
     plus max_examples would therefore yield a subset of pure `general` with no tools
     and no rag in it, silently. Sampling proportionally HERE, and shuffling, is what
     makes a subset representative rather than just short.

Reservoir sampling per split, seeded, so the selection is reproducible from the seed
alone and memory is bounded by the sample rather than the corpus. Two passes: one to
count, one to select, because the per-split quota cannot be computed until the totals
are known.

Usage: build_sources.py <out.jsonl> <target_rows> <seed> <source.jsonl>...
